React Local Setup
=================
1. download Nodejs and install
   https://nodejs.org/en/download/

2. check if nodejs is installed? (open cmd and run the below command)
   node -v 

3. check if NPM is installed? (NPM-Node Package Manager)
   npm -v    

   npm install -g npm@latest - run this command if 4th point doesnot work
   
4.  go to the folder where you want to create project(d:/sanjay/react)& run the below command	
	npx create-react-app project1 (npx-node package executer)

   If I dont want to download the "create-react-app" package/library but want to use it then we have to use npx

   or if we want to download and use create-react-app then we have to follow below approach

   npm i create-react-app - this command is used to install "create-react-app" library
   create-react-app project1 - this command is used to create project using "create-react-app" library which is installed to our system through above command
                 
5. go to the created project folder(project1) and start your React application
   cd project1
   npm start 
  
6. A new browser window will pop up with your newly created React App! 
   open a browser tab and type 'http://localhost:3000/' if browser doesn't open automatically.

please follow the above 6 steps to have react local setup

node package manager(npm) is used to install any library in react js

if we install node js then npm also gets installed along with nodejs

project name - react-project-dec-2023


to run project in cmd we use "npm start" command and if we close cmd then project will stop working.

or go to terminal in vs code and type cmd then it will go to command prompt and then type npm start

shortcut to open terminal - ctrl + ` and the kill the server we need to give ctrl+c then the project will end.

npm is a place where all the libraries are available to install

if only a portion of page gets reloaded then it is called single page applicatin if not it is a multipage application
